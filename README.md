# Django_LoginSystem
It is a basic Login-Logout System with Django's built-in user-authentication system.

## Understanding:
  1) When we create a Django Project, Django automatically installs the auth app which can be seen under *INSTALLED_APPS* in *settings.py* file.
  2) Now in order to use auth app, we need to add it to our project-level *urls.py* file.
  3) To create a Login Page, Django by default will look within a templates folder called *registration* for auth templates. The login template is called *login.html*.
